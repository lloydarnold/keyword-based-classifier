Hi,
I’m contacting you as I’m enquiring about building an education-based app for our company Self-Build Zone.
Background on our company,
Self-Build Zone is the market leader in Self-Build Insurance and Structural Warranties in the UK. We work with the largest publishers in the industry to promote our services with an emphasis on education (including working with this season of Grand Designs: The Street).
The App Concept
We intend to build an education-based app based on our knowledge to guide the a self-builder through their build
Apps capabilities
•       Automation – if they click yes to something the summary page must show it as a tick.
•       Educational videos- sometimes we may do a pop up video option instead of the important information notice.
•       Compatible on android and IOS
•       Send push notifications
•       Have a calendar of events for the project so the correc push notification can be sent.
•       Optional potential useful-
•       Ability to upload pictures
•       Sold google ad space (only after start)
Are you able to supply a rough quote or able to do a meeting in the next two weeks to discuss the project further?
Kind regards
